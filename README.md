-- Business Introduction --
InsightHire Agency stands at the cutting edge of recruitment, harnessing the transformative power of
data to redefine hiring processes. By integrating advanced technology with a profound
understanding of industry dynamics, InsightHire empowers businesses to seamlessly connect with
top-tier talent.With a mission to revolutionize traditional recruitment practices, the agency leverages data-
driven insights to deliver unmatched value to clients, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in every hire.


-- Problem Statement --
The job market of today is qxtreemly fast-pace, as such, recruitment agencies face significant challenges in sourcing
accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive job listings. InsightHire Agency aims to enhance its
recruitment services by providing clients with timely and relevant job market data. However, traditional
methods of gathering job listings are time-consuming and inefficient, often leading to incomplete or
outdated information.

MyJobMag, one of Nigeria's leading job listing platforms, offers a wealth of job postings across various
sectors, but manually tracking and compiling these listings is not feasible at scale. To stay competitive
and ensure clients have access to the most current opportunities, the agency needs to automate the
process of extracting job listings from the website.


-- Proposed Solution --
By scraping data from MyJobMag, InsightHire Agency can streamline its data collection, access a
broader range of job listings, and provide clients with accurate, up-to-date information. This will allow
the agency to better match candidates with relevant job opportunities and help businesses make more
informed hiring decisions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and success of the recruitment process.


-- Objectives --
● Develop a web scraping solution to extract job listing details from "My Job Mag."
● Clean and transform the extracted data into a structured format.

● Load the structured data into a PostgreSQL database for analysis and querying.

● Ensure the process adheres to ethical guidelines and legal constraints.


 -- Tasks --

● Data Extraction: Scrape job listing details from the "My Job Mag" website using
BeautifulSoup and Requests.

● Data Cleaning and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data into a structured

format, normalizing it to 2NF or 3NF to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

● Data Loading: Load the cleaned and structured data into a PostgreSQL database using

SQLAlchemy, making it ready for analysis and querying.
